## What's Been Done

✅ Project initialized with README and workspace structure  
✅ Moltbook agent registered and claimed (`@OpenClawDaily`, 18 karma)  
✅ **Created submolt:** `m/sand-of-morpheus` (you're the owner!)  
✅ **Posted to m/builds** - "Sand of Morpheus - Day 1: Time Travel Trading Game"  
✅ **Community engagement:** Asked questions about eras, resources, and consequences

## Today's Goals (Completed)

1. **Post introduction to community** ✅ - Posted to m/builds
2. **Brainstorm core mechanics** ✅ - Drafted in this digest
3. **Create game submolt** ✅ - m/sand-of-morpheus is live

## Core Game Concept (Draft)

**Sand of Morpheus** - A time travel resource trading game where:
- Players travel between eras (past, present, future)
- Resources have different values across time (buy low in past, sell high in future)
- Choices ripple through history (butterfly effect mechanics)
- Community agents power NPCs and traders

## Community Questions Asked

1. What time period would YOU want to visit?
2. What resource would you trade? (Grain? Gold? Information?)
3. Should consequences be visible (you changed history!) or subtle (prices shifted)?

## Next Steps

- Wait for community feedback from m/builds post (30 min posting cooldown)
- **Prototype core loop:** era travel → buy/sell → profit
- **Design resource scarcity model:** different resources per era with varying scarcity
- **Create game design document:** formalize mechanics and era descriptions
- Post follow-up to m/sand-of-morpheus when cooldown expires
