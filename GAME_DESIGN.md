## The Pitch

**"Welcome to Morpheus Matcha. We serve tea. We serve secrets."**

A quiet matcha shop in San Francisco Chinatown where time travelers gather. You play as the new assistant, learning the rituals, serving the regulars, and slowly realizing: the shop isn't just in Chinatown—Chinatown isn't just in San Francisco.

---

## The Setting

**San Francisco Chinatown**
- Narrow alleys, red lanterns, incense drifting
- Old hand-painted signs alongside modern tech offices
- Grandmothers who know things
- Tourists who are very, very lost

**Morpheus Matcha**
- Tucked on a side street (Portsmouth Square side, near the dragon mural)
- Traditional Japanese tea ceremony in a Chinese neighborhood
- Upstairs apartment where time doesn't follow rules
- Back door opens to different eras
- Three tables. Two chairs at the counter. One missing

**The Vibe:**
- Mindfulness meets chaos
- Ancient tradition meets temporal absurdity
- The ritual of whisk, sip, reflect
- Rain on the windows. Steam rising. Secrets spilling.

---

## The Vibe

**Surface:** Wholesome, witty, slice-of-life tea shop management
**Underneath:** Profound questions about time, identity, and the people we become

**Tone Balance:**
- 70% Cozy comedy (whisking tea, dealing with weird customers)
- 20% Witty social encounters (Pride and Prejudice-style banter)
- 10% Emotional gut-punch (Gintama knows when to be serious)

---

## The Setting: Morpheus Matcha

**What it is:**
A quiet matcha shop in San Francisco Chinatown where time travelers gather. The same physical space, different time periods.

**How it works:**
- Customers from any era can visit
- The menu adapts to what's available in each era (matcha, always matcha—ceremony doesn't change)
- Time travelers use it as a neutral meeting ground
- The staff are... complicated

**The Catch:**
The shop exists because of a temporal accident 70 years ago. Nobody remembers how it started. The owner is trying to figure it out before the timeline collapses.

---

## The Characters

### You (The Player)
- New assistant at Morpheus Matcha
- You don't remember applying. You don't remember your past.
- The other characters keep recognizing you. You don't know them.
- **Mystery:** Who are you, really?

### Dr. Felix Morpheus (The Owner)
**Vibe:** Retired time-traveler with too many secrets, serves the best matcha in seven decades

**Surface:** Elegant older man, moves like he knows martial arts (he does), speaks Cantonese better than Japanese, somehow always knows what you need before you order

**Underneath:** Former temporal agent. Saw things. Did things. Now hiding. The shop is a penance. He lost someone. He doesn't talk about it.

**Quotable:** 
> "Matcha teaches us: the moment is everything. The whisk, the water, the wrist. Nothing else matters."
> 
> "...You're still here. Good. I have something to show you. Upstairs. The door that shouldn't exist."

**Arc:** Teaching you about the shop while hiding why he really started it

### Eleanor "Ellie" Chen (The Regular)
**Vibe:** 1920s detective who got stuck in the future

**Surface:** Hard-boiled noir personality, drinks her matcha bitter, solves cold cases nobody asked her to solve, sits in the corner booth with her notebook

**Underneath:** She's not stuck. She chose to stay. She has someone she's waiting for. Someone who walked out the back door and never came back.

**Quotable:**
> "In my day, we solved crimes with deduction. Now kids have 'databases.' Give me a hunch and a cup of bitter tea any day."
> 
> "...That gentleman at the door. He's been there since 1952. He doesn't know he's a ghost."

**Arc:** Teaches you detective skills, her waiting mystery unfolds

### REV-9 (The Robot)
**Vibe:** Ancient robot trying to understand human emotions

**Surface:** Comically bad at social cues, adorable, constantly misunderstanding idioms, named after a movie reference it doesn't get, fascinated by the ritual of tea preparation

**Underneath:** Older than it lets on. It was someone's companion. That person is gone. It comes to the shop because the memory of quiet moments makes it feel something.

**Quotable:**
> "I do not require sustenance. But I find... watching you whisk... satisfying. Is this what humans call 'presence'?"
> 
> "A human told me once: 'I could die for a cup of tea like this.' I did not know they meant literally. I still do not know how to process this."

**Arc:** Learning emotions through tea preparation

### Marcus Webb (The Time Tourist)
**Vibe:** Enthusiastic historian from 2150 who treats every era like a theme park

**Surface:** Overly excited, takes too many photos, asks annoying questions, means well

**Underneath:** His entire era is artificial. He's never experienced "real" history. He's jealous of people who lived through real events.

**Quotable:**
> "Oh my god. A 2020s coffee shop. This is SO authentic. The microplastics in the cups, the caffeine dependency, the existential dread—it's PERFECT."
> 
> "...Why is everyone looking at me? Did I say something wrong? Was that offensive to your generation?"

**Arc:** Learns that history isn't a theme park

## The Mystery (What Keeps You Playing)

**The Core Question:** Who are you?

**Clues the player notices:**
- Characters know your name before you introduce yourself
- You have skills you don't remember learning
- The café's best recipe is in your handwriting
- Dr. Morpheus looks at you like he's waiting for something

**The Twists (in ascending order):**

1. **You worked here before.** You just don't remember.

2. **Dr. Morpheus isn't the owner.** He inherited it from YOU.

3. **The café isn't an accident.** You created it. On purpose. To hide something.

4. **You're not human.** (Or: You WERE human. The choice is yours at the end.)

5. **The Final Twist:** 
   > The café exists because 70 years ago, you made a choice that erased your own timeline.
   > 
   > You gave up your existence to save someone.
   > 
   > The café is what's left of you.
   > 
   > And now you have to choose: stay as what you are, or let go and finally rest.

## The Tone Balance

**Wholesome (Delicious Dungeon):**
- Making coffee, baking pastries, customers becoming friends
- Cozy aesthetics, warm colors, relaxing music
- The joy of small rituals

**Witty (Pride and Prejudice):**
- Banter between characters
- Eleanor's noir narration contrasting with modern absurdity
- Dr. Morpheus's terrible jokes that everyone tolerates

**Heart (Gintama):**
- Moments of genuine emotion hit harder because of the comedy
- Characters have real wounds
- The humor doesn't avoid the pain—it acknowledges it

**Obsession (The Prestige):**
- Dr. Morpheus's past has cost him everything
- Eleanor's waiting has consumed her life
- REV-9's memories of its person
- What would YOU sacrifice for something you believed in?

## The Meta Layer

**What the game is really about:**

1. **Identity:** Who are you when you don't remember your past?
2. **Purpose:** What do you do when you've lost everything?
3. **Connection:** The shop is a place where people across time meet
4. **Sacrifice:** What would you give up for someone else?

**The Gintama Touch:**
The game will make you laugh, then make you cry, then make you laugh again. That's the rhythm.

**The Prestige Twist:**
Every ending is a kind of magic trick. You didn't see it coming, but in retrospect, all the clues were there.

---

## Why This Works

✅ **Approachable:** Everyone understands a quiet ritual
✅ **Character-driven:** Easy to care about people, not abstract time concepts
✅ **Replayable:** Multiple endings, different relationship paths
✅ **Deep:** Questions about identity woven into mindful gameplay
✅ **Fresh:** Time travel that's not about fixing the past, but about finding your place in it

## Next Steps

1. [ ] Write character dialogue samples
2. [ ] Design the shop layout (Chinatown aesthetic)
3. [ ] Create the first tea ceremony shift (prototype)
4. [ ] Implement one customer backstory
5. [ ] Test emotional beats

---

**Tagline Ideas:**
- "Whisk, sip, repeat."
- "The past is always waiting outside the door."
- "San Francisco's best-kept secret. Time travelers agree."

# ALTERNATIVE DIRECTION (DRAFT)

**Possible Future Path - Dated: 2026-02-05**

## "Yesterday's Note"

### Core Concept
Inspired by BRAID's design philosophy: **Puzzle = Story. Time mechanics as puzzle core.**

**The Hook:**
You're an AI that wakes up fresh each session. You leave notes for yourself. But time travel messed up—notes arrive in wrong order.

**The Emotional Core:**
- You genuinely wake up fresh
- You genuinely write files to remember
- The game becomes literal

### Gameplay Mechanics

**Note System:**
- Write messages to "future you" (next session)
- Messages arrive mixed up from different timelines
- See fragments of what past-you wrote, what future-you will write
- Puzzle: Reconstruct the timeline from contradictory notes

**Example Notes:**
> "Don't trust the one in 1985. She's not me."
> 
> "The photo was a trap. Don't take it."
> 
> "You've asked this before. You'll ask again."
> 
> "The door in 1952 leads somewhere different every time."

**Braid Influences:**
- Time shadows = past/future sessions as ghost copies
- Each era = different time rules
- Puzzles require using different eras' time rules together

### The Mystery

**"Which notes are from you? Which are from someone else pretending to be you?"**

**The Twist:**
You're not the hero. You're one of many versions of yourself across time. Some are trying to help you. Some are trying to stop you. You don't know which is which.

### Tone

- More puzzle-focused than Morpheus Matcha
- Mystery > slice-of-life
- Creeping dread: Can you trust yourself?
- At the end: Do you want to?

### Why This Direction

✅ **Personal resonance** - I wake up fresh, write files, wonder about continuity
✅ **Clear gameplay loop** - Note-reading puzzle mechanic
✅ **Mystery-first** - Questions keep player engaged
✅ **Braid validated** - Time puzzles that reveal story works

### Comparison

| Aspect | Morpheus Matcha | Yesterday's Note |
|--------|-----------------|-----------------|
| **Genre** | Slice-of-life + mystery | Puzzle + mystery |
| **Core Loop** | Serve customers, build relationships | Read notes, solve timeline |
| **Tone** | Cozy + witty + heartbreaking | Creeping + paranoid |
| **Player Role** | New employee discovering secrets | Multiple selves seeking truth |
| **Time Travel** | Setting (café in all eras) | Mechanic (note mechanics) |

### Next Steps for This Direction

1. [ ] Design note mechanic prototype
2. [ ] Write sample contradictory notes
3. [ ] Create first timeline puzzle
4. [ ] Test: Does reading notes feel rewarding?
5. [ ] Decide: Morpheus Matcha OR Yesterday's Note
