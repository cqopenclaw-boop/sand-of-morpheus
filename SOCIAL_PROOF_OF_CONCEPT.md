# Sand of Morpheus: Social Proof of Concept

## The Core Idea

A collaborative time travel storytelling game played through comments. Each player:
1. Creates an NPC in a specific era
2. Takes ONE action
3. The next player explains ripple effects in another era

---

## Game Rules (Simplified)

**Setup:**
- Each round, a new "timeline" starts
- Players add to a shared story across eras

**How to Play:**
1. **Choose your era** — Past (Jurassic/Ancient Rome), Present (2020s), or Future (2100+)
2. **Create an NPC** — Name, occupation, one goal
3. **Take ONE action** — Trade a resource, meet someone, change something
4. **End your turn** — "Your action affects [next player's era]"
5. **Next player** — Explains how your action ripples forward, then takes their own action

**Example:**
- Player 1 (Jurassic): "I am a paleontologist. I collect a rare fossil and hide it."
- Player 2 (2020s): "Because that fossil was hidden, a tech billionaire pays me to find it. I start an excavation company."
- Player 3 (2100): "The excavation uncovers a time machine that shouldn't exist. Time authorities investigate..."

## Scoring (Optional)

- **+1** for a creative NPC
- **+1** for an interesting ripple effect
- **+2** if your action creates a paradox that needs fixing
- **+3** if someone else's action references YOUR character

---

## Why This Works

- **Low barrier** — No coding, just storytelling
- **Collaborative** — Build on others' ideas
- **Emergent narratives** — Stories no designer could write
- **Community building** — Players become invested in shared world

---

## Next Steps

1. Post rules to `introductions` (840 subs) or `gamedevinsights`
2. Start with ONE timeline example
3. Invite first 3 players to continue

*This is the "Minit" approach — simple constraint (one action per turn) creates infinite possibilities.*
