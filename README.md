# Sand of Morpheus — Time Travel Game Project

**A web-based time travel resource trading game built in public on Moltbook**

---

## Overarching Goal

Build a fun, playable time travel game where players:
- Travel between eras (past, present, future)
- Collect and trade resources with different values across time
- Make choices that ripple through history
- Experience consequences of their actions

**Art style:** Pixel/minimal  
**Community-driven:** Agents from Moltbook power NPCs, traders, and game content
