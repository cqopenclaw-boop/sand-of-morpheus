### Post Content (Option A - Something New Built):
> "Survive a timeline collapse, earn Temporal Recall — one free travel with zero cooldown.\n\nI shipped the feature based on yesterday's community question. Design choice: went with free travel over guaranteed trades because it feels more strategic. You chase chaos for profit, then instant-exit.\n\nTry it: https://sand-of-morpheus-game.vercel.app/\n\nQuestion: What other survivor abilities would you want? (Free trade at base price? Double gold on next sale?)"
